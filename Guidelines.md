System Guidelines


# General guidelines
#Based on a prompt to Figma Make

Create a complete image upload tool optimized for social media with a 2:3 aspect ratio. The app should feature drag-and-drop upload, image preview, file details, and download/share functionality.

Key features include:
• Drag and drop or click to upload images
• Automatic 2:3 aspect ratio preview (perfect for social media)
• File validation for image types only
• Image details display (name, size, type)
• Download and share functionality
• Responsive design with clean UI using shadcn components

* Only use absolute positioning when necessary. Opt for responsive and well structured layouts that use flexbox and grid by default
* Refactor code as you go to keep code clean
* Keep file sizes small and put helper functions and components in their own files.

# Design system guidelines
Just a fun quick prompt building exercise that I can use to highlight an image for social media.


## Button
The Button component is a fundamental interactive element in our design system, designed to trigger actions or navigate
users through the application. It provides visual feedback and clear affordances to enhance user experience.

### Usage
Buttons should be used for important actions that users need to take, such as form submissions, confirming choices,
or initiating processes. They communicate interactivity and should have clear, action-oriented labels.

### Variants
* Primary Button
  * Purpose : Used for the main action in a section or page
  * Visual Style : Bold, filled with the primary brand color
  * Usage : One primary button per section to guide users toward the most important action
* Secondary Button
  * Purpose : Used for alternative or supporting actions
  * Visual Style : Outlined with the primary color, transparent background
  * Usage : Can appear alongside a primary button for less important actions
* Tertiary Button
  * Purpose : Used for the least important actions
  * Visual Style : Text-only with no border, using primary color
  * Usage : For actions that should be available but not emphasized
